#Q: 3. If you run a 10 kilometer race in 42 minutes 42 seconds, what is your average
#       pace (time per mile in minutes and seconds)? What is your average speed in
#       miles per hour?


total_ks = 10
total_miles = 10/1.61
total_time_in_secs = 42*60 + 42

pace_per_hour = total_ks/total_time_in_secs*60*60

print(pace_per_hour)
